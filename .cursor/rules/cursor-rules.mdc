# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

1. Always place rule files in `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/`:

  ```
  .cursor/rules/
  ├── your-rule-name.mdc
  ├── another-rule.mdc
  └── ...
  ```

2. Follow the naming convention:

  - Use kebab-case for filenames
  - Always use .mdc extension
  - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:

  ```
  PROJECT_ROOT/
  ├── .cursor/
  │   └── rules/
  │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
  │       └── ...
  └── ...
  ```

4. Never place rule files:
  - In the project root
  - In subdirectories outside `.cursor/rules`
  - In any other location
5. At the end of the rule, add this instruction:
   ```
	 When you use this rule file, mention this rule file is being used by mentioning the rule filename.
	 ```
6. Add examples to the rules when possible. Add both good examples and bad examples:

```typescript
// ✅ Good example
function goodExample() {
  // Implementation following guidelines
}

// ❌ Bad example
function badExample() {
  // Implementation not following guidelines
}
```
