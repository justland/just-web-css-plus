# File Naming Conventions

This document provides clear examples of good and bad file naming practices in our project.

## General Rules

1. Use lowercase letters
2. Avoid special characters except hyphens and periods
5. Use descriptive, meaningful names
6. Keep names concise but clear
7. Avoid using numbers in file names unless necessary
8. Use meaningful suffixes to indicate file type/purpose

Examples:

```sh
# ✅ Good examples
user-profile.tsx
user-profile.types.tsx
auth-service.ts
auth-service.ctx.ts
button-group.stories.tsx
button-group.some-prop.stories.tsx

# ❌ Bad examples
UserProfile.tsx
authService.ts
button_group.stories.tsx
form1.tsx
service.ts
```

Remember: Consistency is key. When in doubt, follow the established patterns in the codebase.
